**MANDATORY FIRST STEP**: Read and summarize BOTH `architecture.md` and `claude.md` â€” show me the key conventions, triggers, and clean architecture rules before proceeding.

We are going to **EXPLORE** the $ARGUMENTS of the application.

**REQUIRED STEPS**:
1. Read all relevant files and modules related to this area.
2. Reference `architecture.md` for boundaries, layers, and dependencies.
3. Identify key components, contracts (proto/HTTP), and data models.
4. Note RBAC, audit logging, or other cross-cutting concerns in scope.
5. List deviations from conventions or potential risks.

**VERIFICATION**:
- [ ] Read and referenced architecture.md
- [ ] Read and referenced claude.md
- [ ] Identified all relevant files/modules
- [ ] Mapped component relationships
- [ ] Noted convention deviations
