**MANDATORY FIRST STEP**: Read `architecture.md` for applicable patterns and constraints.

We are going to **RFC** for $ARGUMENTS.

**REQUIRED OUTPUT**:
- **Problem / Goal** (why we need this)
- **Scope** (in / out)
- **API / Contracts** (proto/HTTP request/response + status codes)
- **Data Model Changes** (tables/entities/fields, migrations)
- **Acceptance Criteria** (5–8 testable bullets)
- **Non‑Functionals** (RBAC, audit, performance, error handling)

**CHECKLIST**:
- [ ] Patterns align with architecture.md
- [ ] Acceptance criteria are observable/testable
- [ ] Security & audit covered
